This file describes the changes made to Python by MicroForte. The source was
originally downloaded from http://www.python.org/download as Python-2.4.tgz.

11th September 2003
builtin.dir can now handle any sequence for __members__ and __methods__, not
just PyList.

29th September 2003
typeobject.c looks in tp_dict for __module__ and __name__ for all type
objects, not just ones with the heap flag set.

3rd October 2003
Added low-level memory allocator redirection (low_level_malloc + friends)

15th December 2003
Added an interface to provide a different filename namespace.
This consists of the extern-able calls PyOS_fopen, PyOS_statType,
PyOS_listdir and PyOS_dlopen.  They are declared in pythonrun.h with
other PyOS stuff. They allow another filesystem to be inserted
underneath Python.

16th January 2004
ALTSEP is defined to be equal to SEP if not otherwise defined
(simplifies some code)

11th May 2004
In the generic getattr, now checking if tp_mro is set instead of always
assuming it is if tp_dict is set. Builtin types like descriptors seem
to not have this set.

18th September 2006
Integrated changes into Python 2.5. Some of our modifications were not
integrated:
- math, struct, time, _weakref, cString, cPickle are no longer compiled into
libpython2.5.a. Modules will now be shipped as .so files.
- ALTSEP is no longer always defined. Changed our code to handle this case.
- Low-level memory redirection has been removed.
- os.tempnam() and os.tmpnam() no longer returns an error when BigWorld's
file system is used. Instead, they are no longer built into the os module.
- PyObject_GenericGetAttr() no longer checks if tp->tp_mro is set.
- Compiler define PYTHONPATH is no longer set to "" on Windows.

Python must be configured with:
	$ ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4

To build the dynamically loadable modules (.so):
- First you must build a stock standard Python interpreter:
	$ ./configure --enable-unicode=ucs4
	$ make
- Then make BigWorld's modified libpython2.5.a in src/lib/python:
	$ make libpython2.5.a
- Then you copy the interpreter you've just built into src/lib/python:
	$ cp standard_python_distribution/python src/lib/python
- Finally build the modules in src/lib/python:
	$ make sharedmods
  The modules will be located in src/lib/python/build/lib.linux-i686-2.5, or
  something similar.

10th August 2006
Customised PC/config.c, Include/Python.h, and Python/import.c to enable
WingIDE support for the BigWorld client.

18th October 2006
Customised VC8 project files.

19th January 2007
Instrumented src/lib/python/Objects/objects.h to allow reference count
debugging, disabled by default. When enabled, it makes use of two externally
defined functions, intercept_incref and intercept_decref.

16th February 2007
Instrumented src/lib/python/Objects/objects.c to assert whenever python is
accessed from a thread other than the main thread. To check the thread, it
uses the extern function check_thread, which is defined in bigworld's file
src/lib/pyscript/pyobject_plus.cpp.
