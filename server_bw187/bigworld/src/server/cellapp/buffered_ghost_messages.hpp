 *	This class is used to buffer ghost messages that have arrived out of order.
 *	Messages from a single CellApp are ordered but if the real entity is
 *	offload, some ghost messages may arrive too soon.
 *
 *	To get around this problem, we consider the lifespan of a ghost as being
 *	split into subsequence of messages from each CellApp that the real visits.
 *	The Real entity tells ghosts of the next address before offloading. This
 *	allows the ghost to chain these subsequences together and play them in the
 *	correct order.
